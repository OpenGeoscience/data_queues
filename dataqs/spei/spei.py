    description = """The SPEI Global Drought Monitor (http://sac.csic.es/spei/)
offers near real-time information about drought conditions at the global scale,
with a 0.5 degrees spatial resolution and a monthly time resolution. SPEI
time-scales between 1 and 48 months are provided. The calibration period for the
 SPEI is January 1950 to December 2010.
\n\nThe dataset is updated during the first days of the following month based on
 the most reliable and updated sources of climatic data. Mean temperature data
are obtained from the NOAA NCEP CPC GHCN_CAMS gridded dataset. Monthly
precipitation sums data are obtained from the Global Precipitation Climatology
Centre (GPCC). Data from the 'first guess' GPCC product, with an original
resolution of 1ยบ, are interpolated to the resolution of 0.5ยบ.\n\nCurrently,
the SPEI Global Drought Monitor is based on the Thortnthwaite
equation for estimating potential evapotranspiration, PET. This is due to the
lack of real-time data sources for computing more robust PET estimations which
have larger data requirements. The main advantage of the SPEI Global Drought
Monitor is thus its near real-time character, a characteristic best suited for
drought monitoring and early warning purposes. For long-term analysis, however,
other datasets are to be preferred that rely on more robust methods of PET
estimation. Use of the SPEIbase dataset, which is based on the FAO-56
Penman-Monteith model, is thus recommended for climatological studies of
drought.\n\nSource: http://notos.eead.csic.es/spei/nc/"""
